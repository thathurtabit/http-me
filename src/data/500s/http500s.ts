  Internal Server Error server error response code indicates
  that the server encountered an unexpected condition that
  prevented it from fulfilling the request.

  This error response is a generic "catch-all" response.
  Usually, this indicates the server cannot find a better
  5xx error code to response. Sometimes, server administrators
  log error responses like the 500 status code with more
  details about the request to prevent the error from happening
  again in the future.`,

  status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to

  This status is not generated by origin servers, but by
  intercepting proxies that control access to the network.
  
  Network operators sometimes require some authentication,
  acceptance of terms, or other user interaction before granting
  access (for example in an internet caf√© or at an airport).
  They often identify clients who have not done so using their
  Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.
