If you're anything like me, you'll forget all but a handful of HTTP Status Codes, so why not install and then run a quick lookup from your terminal?

## Install

```bash
npm i -g http-me
```
or
```bash
yarn global add http-me
```

---

## Usage example
In your terminal, enter `http-me` and then a status code number, ie: `http-me 401`:

Or you can search for a status code by name, ie: `http-me "accepted"`:

<img width="575" alt="http-me-accepted" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1598625/177379446-7facbb98-d004-4a85-b7e8-93d06346e3fa.png">

## Uninstall

```bash
npm uninstall -g http-me
```
or
```bash
yarn global remove http-me
